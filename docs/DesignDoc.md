## Executive Summary

This web application allows users to contribute to a homeless charity. The application is managed
by the administrator who can manage the current needs. The user can contribute to the needs they'd like to. 

### Purpose
>  _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a very brief statement about the project and the most
> important user group and user goals._

### Glossary and Acronyms
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a table of terms and acronyms._

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SPA | Single Page |


## Requirements

In a simplified authentication system for a Helper/U-fund Manager application, users log in with just a username, where logging in as "admin" identifies a user as the U-fund Manager. Helpers can view, search, add, or remove needs from their funding basket and checkout to fund chosen needs. U-fund Managers have the authority to add, remove, and edit needs in the system but cannot view Helpers' funding baskets. All data is persisted to files, ensuring that changes are reflected for the next user session. Users will also have the ability to submit suggestion messages to the U-fund Manager. 

### Definition of MVP
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a simple description of the Minimum Viable Product._

### MVP Features
>  _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a list of top-level Epics and/or Stories of the MVP._

### Enhancements
> _**[Sprint 4]** Describe what enhancements you have implemented for the project._


## Application Domain

This section describes the application domain.

![Domain Model](Domain-Analysis-Team1A.png)

> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a high-level overview of the domain for this application. You
> can discuss the more important domain entities and their relationship
> to each other._


## Architecture and Design

This section describes the application architecture.

### Summary

The following Tiers/Layers model shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture. 

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture.png)

The web application, is built using the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. 

The Model stores the application data objects including any functionality to provide persistance. 

The View is the client-side SPA built with Angular utilizing HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The ViewModel provides RESTful APIs to the client (View) as well as any logic required to manipulate the data objects from the Model.

Both the ViewModel and Model are built using Java and Spring Framework. Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below.


### Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts with the web application.

> _Provide a summary of the application's user interface.  Describe, from the user's perspective, the flow of the pages in the web application._


### View Tier
> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of the View Tier UI of your architecture.
> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their
> responsibilities.  This should be a narrative description, i.e. it has
> a flow or "story line" that the reader can follow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** You must  provide at least **2 sequence diagrams** as is relevant to a particular aspects 
> of the design that you are describing.  (**For example**, in a shopping experience application you might create a 
> sequence diagram of a customer searching for an item and adding to their cart.)
> As these can span multiple tiers, be sure to include an relevant HTTP requests from the client-side to the server-side 
> to help illustrate the end-to-end flow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** To adequately show your system, you will need to present the **class diagrams** where relevant in your design. Some additional tips:_
 >* _Class diagrams only apply to the **ViewModel** and **Model** Tier_
>* _A single class diagram of the entire system will not be effective. You may start with one, but will be need to break it down into smaller sections to account for requirements of each of the Tier static models below._
 >* _Correct labeling of relationships with proper notation for the relationship type, multiplicities, and navigation information will be important._
 >* _Include other details such as attributes and method signatures that you think are needed to support the level of detail in your discussion._

### ViewModel Tier
NeedController.java -- This class handles the REST API requests for the Need resource

> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the View
> Tier above._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods._
![ViewModel](ViewModel.png)

### Model Tier
Need.java -- Represents a Need entity 

> _**[Sprint 2, 3 & 4]** Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the View
> Tier above._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods._

## OO Design Principles

Controller (GRASP): A design pattern that assigns the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-UI class that makes decisions and controls the flow of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the UI and the business logic, handling user input and invoking responses in the system.

Single Responsibility Principle (SOLID): A principle that states a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This promotes a cleaner, more modular design by separating concerns within a software system.

> _**[Sprint 2, 3 & 4]** Will eventually address upto **4 key OO Principles** in your final design. Follow guidance in augmenting those completed in previous Sprints as indicated to you by instructor. Be sure to include any diagrams (or clearly refer to ones elsewhere in your Tier sections above) to support your claims._

> _**[Sprint 3 & 4]** OO Design Principles should span across **all tiers.**_

## Static Code Analysis/Future Design Improvements
> _**[Sprint 4]** With the results from the Static Code Analysis exercise, 
> **Identify 3-4** areas within your code that have been flagged by the Static Code 
> Analysis Tool (SonarQube) and provide your analysis and recommendations.  
> Include any relevant screenshot(s) with each area._

> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss **future** refactoring and other design improvements your team would explore if the team had additional time._

## Testing
> _This section will provide information about the testing performed
> and the results of the testing._

### Acceptance Testing
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Report on the number of user stories that have passed all their
> acceptance criteria tests, the number that have some acceptance
> criteria tests failing, and the number of user stories that
> have not had any testing yet. Highlight the issues found during
> acceptance testing and if there are any concerns._

### Unit Testing and Code Coverage
> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss your unit testing strategy. Report on the code coverage
> achieved from unit testing of the code base. Discuss the team's
> coverage targets, why you selected those values, and how well your
> code coverage met your targets._

>_**[Sprint 2 & 4]** **Include images of your code coverage report.** If there are any anomalies, discuss
> those._

## Ongoing Rationale
(2024/02/21): Sprint #1 -- Created the necessary utilities needed to perform cURL operations on the Need entity. Includes functionalities such as creating / deleting need, retrieving specific need, searching need by partial name, updating needs, and listing all needs.
